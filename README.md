Project Title: Intelligent Answer Script Evaluation System

Description:
This system automates the evaluation of online exam answers for colleges. It checks student responses for:

1. Accuracy – It compares answers to the correct ones in the database.


2. Plagiarism – It ensures that answers are not copied, allowing up to 30% similarity.


3. Quality of English – It checks grammar, coherence, and relevance using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.



The system has an easy-to-use interface where students can submit their answers. It uses a text database to evaluate the quality and correctness of each answer. The aim is to reduce manual grading efforts while ensuring fairness and high-quality assessment.
